# Manual confirmation needed

All business information was taken from **https://payhip.com/sopesdetailing**. The following items are **not** listed on the Payhip store and need to be confirmed with Sopes Auto Detailing before relying on them.

---

## Pricing

The Payhip site does not display specific prices; it says **"Call for a free quote"** and **"View pricing and more service details below"** (Notion link). The site uses placeholder base prices and vehicle-size multipliers so the “Starting at $XXX” UI works. **Replace the values in `pricing-data.js` with real prices once confirmed.**

- File: `pricing-data.js`
- Update: `services` (exterior, interior, add-ons) and `maintenance` (biweekly, monthly, bimonthly) base prices and vehicle-size multipliers if needed.

## Maintenance packages

**Bi-weekly, monthly, and bi-monthly maintenance packages are not listed on Payhip.** The Maintenance page exists and uses placeholder pricing and descriptions. Confirm with Sopes Auto Detailing:

- Whether these intervals are offered
- What’s included in each
- Actual pricing

The Maintenance page already shows a disclaimer to visitors.

## Service area and mobile service

**The Payhip store does not specify where Sopes Auto Detailing operates or whether service is mobile.** The Areas page includes a generic map and text (e.g. greater Philadelphia region) and a disclaimer. Confirm with Sopes Auto Detailing:

- Exact service area(s)
- Whether they come to the customer’s location (mobile service)
- Any address or radius to show on the map
